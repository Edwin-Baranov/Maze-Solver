# Maze Solver

This repository contains implementations of a Maze Solver program in multiple programming languages. The program generates random mazes and solves them using various pathfinding algorithms.

## Currently Implemented

- [x] Golang Implementation
  - Uses Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm for maze solving
  - Includes maze generation functionality
  - Features visual display of the maze and solution

## Project Structure

Each language implementation is contained in its own directory:

- `/Go` - Golang implementation
  - Uses modular design with separate packages for board generation, solving, and display
  - Includes unit tests for maze generation and solving
